<!-- Problem Description:
Create an HTML page that demonstrates the use of position property. The page should display 4 boxes, each with a different position value (absolute, relative, fixed, and static). -->
<!-- 
Hints:
Use the position property to set the position of the boxes.
Use top, left, bottom, and right properties to adjust the position of the boxes relative to their parent container. -->

<!-- Test Cases:
Verify that the first box is positioned absolute and has a top and left property set.
Verify that the second box is positioned relative and has a top and left property set.
Verify that the third box is positioned fixed and has a bottom and right property set.
Verify that the fourth box is positioned static. -->

<!-- Solution Approach:
Create an HTML page with 4 div containers representing each box.
Apply different position values to each box using the position property.
Use top, left, bottom, and right properties to adjust the position of each box relative to their parent container.
Add styling to the boxes to give them a visual appearance. -->
